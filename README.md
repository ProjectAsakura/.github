# Project Asakura
Project Asakura is a network reimplementation project for Bandai Namco's arcade racing game series, Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune.

## Components

 - [OpenBanapass](https://github.com/ProjectAsakura/OpenBanapass) - an open-source Banapassport reader DLL implementation for WMMT6 and 6R.
 - [OpenParrot-Asakura](https://github.com/ProjectAsakura/OpenParrot) - a customised fork of OpenParrot with many hacks removed to allow for networking to function correctly.
