# Project Asakura
Project Asakura is a network reimplementation project for Bandai Namco's arcade racing game series, Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune.

## Components
 - [Bayshore](https://github.com/ProjectAsakura/Bayshore) - an open-source network server for Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 6.
 - [OpenBanapass](https://github.com/ProjectAsakura/OpenBanapass) - an open-source Banapassport reader DLL implementation for WMMT6 and 6R.
 - [OpenParrot-Asakura](https://github.com/ProjectAsakura/OpenParrot) - a customised fork of OpenParrot with many hacks removed to allow for networking to function correctly.
 
## Developers
The project was started by [Sylvie Nightshade](https://github.com/ry00001), in June/July 2022. Afterwards, many community contributions - notably by [Kitsu](https://github.com/shiroikitsu8) - have resulted in the project reaching the level of completeness it has.
